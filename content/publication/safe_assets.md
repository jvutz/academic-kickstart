abstract: "This paper investigates the consequences of safe asset shortages for aggregate economic activity in a global economy. We build a model with two countries (Home and Foreign) and emphasize two dimensions of heterogeneity: Home has (i) more developed financial markets and (ii) a smaller share of risk-averse agents compared to Foreign. Safe asset demand by Foreign causes a safety trap, i.e. a liquidity trap in the market for safe assets, which depresses output in both countries. Safe public debt provision expands economic activity in both countries, but the associated tax distortions are borne only by the issuing country. This externality results in the under-provision of safe public debt from a global point of view. Restricting international capital flows allows Home to avoid the safety trap but increases the interest rate paid on its debt and reduces the net interest income on its asset position. "
