abstract: "Deviations from uncovered interest parity (UIP) are one of the most salient empirical patterns in international macroeconomics. Yet, as benchmark open-economy models are solved via linearization, their predictions are silent on the existence and behavior of UIP-deviations. To overcome this challenge, I present a closed-form solution for a benchmark small open-economy (SOE) New Keynesian model when the intertemporal elasticity and several intratemporal elasticities of substitution are equal to one. I find that UIP- deviations are generically different from zero and driven by shocks to foreign output and the covariances of foreign output shocks with shocks to foreign monetary policy and home productivity. Perhaps surprisingly, the optimal monetary policy and its implied UIP-deviations are independent of the SOEâ€™s debt position."
